			<Description>
			Galileo plunged into Jupiter's crushing atmosphere on Sept. 
			21, 2003. The spacecraft was deliberately destroyed to protect one of 
			its own discoveries - a possible ocean beneath the icy crust of the moon 
			Europa.
			
			Galileo changed the way we look at our solar system. The spacecraft was 
			the first to fly past an asteroid and the first to discover a moon of an 
			asteroid. It provided the only direct observations of a comet colliding 
			with a planet.
			
			Galileo was the first to measure Jupiter's atmosphere with a descent 
			probe and the first to conduct long-term observations of the Jovian 
			system from orbit. It found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Europa, 
			Ganymede and Callisto and revealed the intensity of volcanic activity on 
			Io.
